            The role, objective, and messaging of my portfolio are key to
            consider. My portfolio will serve as a representation of my own
            skills, accomplishments, and experiences. It will provide an
            overview of my capabilities and qualifications to give potential
            clients confidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            My portfolio will showcase the work that I have completed and the
            type of work I am capable of. My reputation will grow as I build on
            my portfolio and by keeping my portfolio fresh and dynamic, I will
            keep potential clients interested in my work. I can enhance my
            reputation giving more opportunities to expand my horizons with work
            and networking. My portfolio conveys my personal branding and unique
            style. The aim is to communicate this clearly through my portfolio,
            and help people understand how I could help them.

          <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
          <p>
            The industry professionals for the networking event at UC were Elsy
            Gonzalez and Josh Garrard from CRE8IVE, Manny Galaktidis from Even
            Dots Studio and Andrew Gibbon from the Synergy Group. In my opinion,
            the CRE8IVE team were very relatable, because they came through CIT.
            Manny Galaktidis and Andrew Gibbon had a lot of insightful knowledge
            and advice. All of them presented an positive and encouraging view
            of the industry.
          </p>
          <h3>FEELINGS</h3>
          <p>
            There wasn’t much information leading up to the networking event, so
            I didn’t know what to expect. I was excited to hear about the
            experience of the industry experts.
          </p>
          <h3>WHAT I FOUND MOST VALUABLE</h3>
          <p>
            At the industry engagement event, I found a substantial amount of
            advice to be valuable. It was encouraged to act as a sponge, to
            absorb as much advice and feedback as possible. Additionally, it was
            suggested that brainstorming and sketching should be done prior to
            researching, to prevent ideas from being narrowed down prematurely.
            Furthermore, it was advised to seek out freelance opportunities
            outside of university, as employers find this to be an impressive
            attribute. Moreover, it was encouraged to share work and solicit
            feedback. It was also urged to overcome any emotion when receiving
            critiques. Finally, it was reminded to understand the body’s limits
            to prevent burnout.
          </p>
          <h3>WHO I MADE CONNECTIONS WITH</h3>
          <p>
            Although I didn’t make connections with the industry professionals,
            I made valuable connections with students from the design related
            courses.
          </p>
          <h3>WHAT I MIGHT DO DIFFERENTLY NEXT TIME</h3>
          <p>
            I found myself anxious and not wanting to ask questions. I ended up
            not contributing to the event. Next time I would like to ask
            questions and be more involved in the event.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would like to go up to the professionals after the event and put
            that extra effort in to make that connection with them.

          <h3>WHAT I LEARNED</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout this semester I’ve learnt more about myself, my skills,
            interests and my needs. I’ve learnt how how to conduct myself
            professionally by meeting representatives from the industry. I’ve
            been challenged by my difficulty with time management (lack
            thereof), and notice that I can feel stressed and overwhelmed at
            times as a result.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is good that I have been able to reflect on these aspects that I
            have learned about myself because it will help me to grow as a
            person and as a designer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned that I am very interested in and motivated to do the work
            in this unit but find it difficult and time consuming to put my
            thoughts in to words. I am however, improving and my confidence is
            also improving.
          </p>
          <h3>WHAT I FOUND USEFUL</h3>
          <p>
            I have found the content of this semester very interesting. This is
            an essential unit which takes an in depth look into the industry and
            provides the requirement to self reflect.
          </p>
          <h3>WHAT HELD ME BACK?</h3>
          <p>
            My ADD has proven difficult to manage this semester, I have missed
            classes due to needing to focus on work when I have the energy. I
            have really appreciated the support of my lecturers.
          </p>
          <h3>HOW I COULD IMPROVE MY OUTCOMES NEXT SEMESTER</h3>
          <p>
            I will create a timetable and semester plan before classes start to
            allocate my time and make it easier to not become so overwhelmed. I
            will need to review this plan weekly and I have engaged a mentor to
            help me keep on track.
          </p>
          <h3>WHAT I HOPE TO BUILD UPON IN FUTURE UNITS</h3>
          <p>
            I am really enjoying this degree and don’t want the ADD to hold me
            back, however it is difficult, and I am still learning how to
            overcome the challenges and work with the strengths. I need to find
            a way to use my strengths and not be overwhelmed with the
            disadvantages.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wish to build upon my networking skills, continue to improve my
            writing skills (mostly by giving myself more time) and make use of a
            diary and weekly goals to stay on track and avoid the last minute
            high pressure to get assignments in on time.

          <h3>WHY IS EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE IMPORTANT?</h3>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence (the Emotional Quotient - EQ) came later than
            Intellectual Intelligence (measured as the Intelligence Quotient -
            IQ) as a concept but has been recognised as equally important. It is
            an important skill and set of attributes that helps someone to be
            successful in work and personal relationships. We are a social
            species and being with people, getting along, managing conflict, are
            necessary for wellbeing and good interpersonal relationships.
          </p>
          <h3>WHAT ARE EMOTIONS</h3>
          <p>
            Hasson describes emotions as made up of several parts: Physical
            sensations, thoughts, and behaviours. Hasson goes on to say that
            emotions are fleeting, differ in intensity, and are felt
            differently. For example, anger is a different experience to
            sadness. Emotions also differ according to the situation or context.
            Sadness might be felt in a situation of loss, or anger might be
            experienced in a situation where we are being attacked.
          </p>
          <h3>MANAGING EMOTIONS</h3>
          <p>
            Hasson says we need to manage emotions to improve Emotional
            Intelligence. However, more recent research shows that of the 3
            characteristics of emotions, thoughts, sensations and behaviour, the
            thoughts and sensations of emotions are very difficult to control or
            change (Harris, 2021). We can change how we respond to emotions
            (behaviour) to make sure our behaviour is helpful and to make sure
            we don’t over or under react.
          </p>
          <h3>RESPONDING TO EMOTIONS</h3>
          <p>
            To respond helpfully to emotions, we first need to be aware, or
            notice, the emotion we are experiencing. We cannot manage our
            behaviour response to emotions in a situation without first
            realising what we are experiencing. This knowledge also prevents us
            from trying to avoid emotions, which as Hasson says, are part of
            being human. For example, anger is a normal emotion, but it is
            important that we know how to communicate it without causing harm to
            anyone, or anything else. If we try and avoid an emotion like anger,
            we may not be able to defend ourselves appropriately.
          </p>
          <h3>COMMUNICATION IS NOT THE SAME AS EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE</h3>
          <p>
            Hasson focusses on communication as if it is the same as EQ.
            However, some people are very good communicators but might not be
            very aware of their own emotions or anyone else’s (Harris, 2021)
            Some people can manipulate communication for their own reasons or to
            meet their own needs. Hasson does make important points about good
            respectful communication such as using “I” language, but
            communication is only a part of EQ.
          </p>
          <h3>IMPROVING EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE</h3>
          <p>
            Harris (Harris, 2021) states that knowing what is important to us
            (values) helps us with our emotional experiences because our values
            guide our behaviour. Mindfulness practice increases our
            self-awareness and so helps us to understand our emotions. Hasson
            gives the suggestion to do slow breathing if we are angry but
            without self-awareness, we can react to the anger without realising
            what is happening or be unable to express it at all.
          </p>
          <h3>THE PROBLEM WITH BODY LANGUAGE</h3>
          <p>
            Hasson emphasises communication too much for its role in emotional
            intelligence. Hasson says that understanding body language is
            important but does not describe how to learn this. Hasson does give
            the caution about being too confident about reading body language.
          </p>
          <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
          <p>
            Hasson has written about emotional intelligence and communication
            skills almost as if they are the same thing. Emotional Intelligence
            is a skill that can be learnt but is also influenced by many things
            like family background, personality, and experiences(Harris, 2021).
            In other words nature and nurture affect our Emotional Intelligence.
            Emotional Intelligence is our ability to understand our own and
            others emotions, and to learn ways to express these to improve our
            relationships with work colleagues, friends and family. It is a
            necessary part of healthy human relationships.
